# ARIMA Time Series Forecasting

This project demonstrates how to perform time series forecasting using the ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model in Python. It covers the complete end-to-end process â€” from data preparation and visualization to model building, evaluation, and forecasting.

## ðŸ“Œ Key Features

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on time series data
- Visualizations for trends, seasonality, and stationarity
- ACF and PACF plots to identify ARIMA parameters
- Implementation of ARIMA model using `statsmodels`
- Evaluation of model performance using RMSE
- Forecasting future values based on the model
